# power-consumption-ml-arm
This project evaluates the power consumption of machine learning inference on ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers. By implementing Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Networks with CMSIS libraries and custom kernels, it compares efficiency across Cortex-M0+ and M4, offering insights for energy-efficient TinyML in IoT devices.
